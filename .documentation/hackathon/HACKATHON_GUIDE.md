# ShortPoint Standalone - Hackathon Development Guide

## Project Overview

**ShortPoint Standalone** is a multi-tenant SaaS intranet solution designed for small to medium businesses. Think of it as "Wix for internal company sites" - allowing organizations to create multiple departmental sites (HR, Finance, IT, Development, Sales) from a single tenant dashboard with controlled access and customization.

## üéØ What You're Building

### Core Concept
- **Multi-tenant architecture** where each company is a tenant
- **Multiple sites per tenant** - one for each department
- **Role-based access control** - Admin users manage everything, Normal users access assigned sites
- **Rich content management** with pages, navigation, themes, and assets
- **Real-time collaboration** features for content editing

### Key User Flows
1. **Admin Flow**: Login ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Create/Manage Sites ‚Üí Configure Navigation ‚Üí Create Pages ‚Üí Customize Themes
2. **Normal User Flow**: Login ‚Üí Access Assigned Sites ‚Üí View Content ‚Üí Interact with Resources

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Recommended Tech Stack (Participants could chose other variants)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with App Router, React 18+, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui components
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: Clerk (email, Google, Facebook SSO)
- **State Management**: Zustand stores + TanStack Query
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for assets
- **Deployment**: Vercel

** Use  @software-requirements-specifications.md as full sofwtaware specifications for the product

## üé® UI/UX Guidelines

### Design System
- **Colors**: Primary Blue (#3161D1), Light backgrounds (#F5F6FA), White cards
- **Typography**: System fonts, consistent hierarchy (H1: 28px, Body: 16px)
- **Layout**: Fixed left sidebar (230px) + main content area
- **Components**: Card-based design with subtle shadows and 4-6px border radius

### Key Interface Patterns
1. **Dashboard Layout**: Left nav + header + card-based content
2. **Site Management**: Two-tier navigation (sidebar + horizontal site nav)
3. **Data Tables**: Sortable columns with inline actions
4. **Forms**: React Hook Form with validation
5. **Modals**: For confirmations and detailed editing

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Full sidebar with multi-column layouts
- **Tablet**: Collapsible sidebar with condensed views
- **Mobile**: Full-screen modals and stacked layouts

** Use .documentation/ux-design-specifications.md as reference for a full ux design specifications for the product

## üéØ Hackathon Success Tips

### Time Management
1. **Start with authentication** - Get Clerk working first
2. **Build the shell** - Create layout and navigation
3. **Focus on one flow** - Complete Admin site creation flow
4. **Add polish last** - Styling and animations are final touches

### Technical Shortcuts
- Use Shadcn/ui components for rapid UI development
- Leverage Prisma Studio for database inspection
- Use mock data for testing (seed script provided)
- Focus on desktop-first, make responsive later

### Demo Preparation
- **Show the user journey** - Start with login, create site, add content
- **Highlight multi-tenancy** - Switch between different company accounts
- **Demonstrate real-time** - Show live updates if implemented
- **Mobile responsiveness** - Show it works on different screen sizes

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't get stuck on authentication configuration
- Don't over-engineer the database schema
- Don't spend too much time on pixel-perfect styling
- Don't ignore error handling completely


## üîß Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Clerk Authentication**: Check environment variables and domain settings
2. **Database Connections**: Verify Prisma schema and connection strings
3. **Routing Issues**: Ensure middleware is properly configured
4. **State Management**: Check Zustand store implementations

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Database
npx prisma studio          # GUI for database inspection
npx prisma db push         # Push schema changes
npx prisma generate        # Regenerate client

# Development
npm run dev                # Start development server
npm run build              # Production build
npm run type-check         # TypeScript validation
```

## üéâ Final Notes

This is a comprehensive full-stack application that showcases modern web development practices. Focus on getting the core multi-tenant functionality working first, then add features incrementally. Remember: a working MVP with good user experience beats a half-finished feature-rich application.

Good luck, and happy coding! üöÄ
