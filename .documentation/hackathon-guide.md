# ShortPoint Standalone - Hackathon Instructions Guide

## Project Overview

**ShortPoint Standalone** is a multi-tenant SaaS intranet solution designed for small to medium businesses. Think of it as "Wix for internal company sites" - allowing organizations to create multiple departmental sites (HR, Finance, IT, Development, Sales) from a single tenant dashboard with controlled access and customization.

## 🎯 What You're Building

### Core Concept
- **Multi-tenant architecture** where each company is a tenant
- **Multiple sites per tenant** - one for each department
- **Role-based access control** - Admin users manage everything, Normal users access assigned sites
- **Rich content management** with pages, navigation, themes, and assets
- **Real-time collaboration** features for content editing

### Key User Flows
1. **Admin Flow**: Login → Dashboard → Create/Manage Sites → Configure Navigation → Create Pages → Customize Themes (Implementation focus should be on the Admin Flow) (Focus of the immplementation)
2. **Normal User Flow**: Login → Access Assigned Sites → View Content → Interact with Resources

## Resources

**Figma design** - https://www.figma.com/design/0dGmhJD0XMayjRrVVdQbpA/ShortPoint-Standalone-Dashboard?node-id=498-24071&m=dev

**Specifications Files** - on Slack #working-with-ai-channel
- **Design Specs**: `ux-design-specifications.md`
- **Product Requirements**: `standalone-product-specifications.md`
- **Technical Specs**: `.software-requirements-specification.md`
- **File Structure**: `.files-and-folder-structure-best-practises.md`
- **Database Rules**: `.database-integration-best-practises.md`
  + Other rules and screenshots 

## Getting Started: Initial Setup

### Step 1: Project Setup
1. **Create a new folder** on your local disk and open it Cursor.
2. **Install Next.js** in the folder (you can ask AI to help you with the install):
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest .
   ```

### Step 2: Documentation Setup
3. **Create a `.documentation` folder** and add the project documentation files available on slack. 
   - `standalone-product-specifications.md`
   - `software-requirements-specification.md`
   - `ux-design-specifications.md`

   **Make sure you go through these documents to understand the specifications**

### Step 3: AI Configuration
4. **Add Cursor rules for AI** in `.cursor/rules` folder (some rules will be provided as a base):
   - `files-and-folder-structure-best-practises.md`
   - `database-integration-best-practises.md`
   - `clerck-setup-specifications.md`

### Step 4. Add Screen shots for reference for the UI
5. **Add screen shots for personal reference and also to feed to AI** in `.documentation/screenshots`

### Step 5: Repository Setup
6. **Push your repository to remote** as a private repository and make sure you commit your changes as often as possible. 
   **Hint**: Use separate branches to implement different features, this will help you move back to the initial code easily if things go in the wrong direction.

### Step 6: Set Prototyping Mode (Recomended, but not mandatory)
7. **Add this note to your AI** to inform it about the development approach:

> **PROTOTYPING MODE INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI:**
> - We are in prototyping mode
> - Develop frontend only, we are mocking up the interface
> - Use dummy JSON to represent data
> - Link all components for navigation
> - Make buttons responsive
> - Don't connect to backend logic
> - Initially, don't connect to a database - use mock data only until UI implementation is complete

### Step 7: Get Next Steps
8. **Ask your AI**: Providing the context of the `.documentation` folder" and ask AI what are the next steps?" Next? Go with the flow!

--------------------------------

## Development Approach: Design Mode First

**IMPORTANT**: Follow this development sequence to maximize your success in the hackathon:

### Phase 1: Design & UI Development (Priority #1)
Start in **design mode** - focus entirely on creating the user interface with mock data before any database integration.

#### 📝 Key Features to Implement

##### Priority 1 (MVP)
1. **Tenant Dashboard** - Site collections overview
2. **Site Home Page View** - Home page structure with Side bar and Top Horizontal Navigation
3. **Site Pages View** - Table view with create/edit/delete functionality
4. **Navigation Builder** - Drag-and-drop menu creation

##### Priority 2 (Enhanced)
1. **Theme Customization** - Color and style controls
2. **Asset Management Page** - File upload and organization
3. **Rich Text Editor** - WYSIWYG editor for page content
4. **Site Settings** - Logo and Favicon + other customizations
5. **Version History** - Page Version history View

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (After UI is Complete)
Only after achieving satisfactory UI implementation:

#### 2.1 Database Integration
- Set up Prisma ORM with the provided schema
- Implement database operations **ONLY through Prisma client**
- Create CRUD operations for:
  - Sites creation and management
  - Pages creation and editing
  - Asset library functionality
  - Theme customization storage

#### 2.2 Required Database Operations
- **Site Management**: Create, read, update, delete sites
- **Page Management**: Create, edit, publish pages with rich text content
- **Asset Management**: Upload, organize, and manage files
- **Theme Storage**: Save and apply custom themes per site

### Phase 3: Authentication Integration (Final Step, Optional)
**Leave Clerk integration for the END** - implement one of these alternatives:

#### Option A: Provide Test Credentials
- Create a simple username/password system for demo purposes
- Provide us with test credentials: `username: admin` / `password: demo123`
- This allows easy access without complex authentication setup

#### Option B: Auto-Assign User to Existing Tenant
- Implement automatic user assignment to a pre-existing tenant
- Skip the complex domain-based tenant assignment logic
- Use a default tenant for all users during the hackathon

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Get basic UI working before adding complexity
2. **Use Mock Data**: Don't get stuck on database setup early on
3. **Focus on Core UX**: Nail the essential user experience first
4. **Incremental Development**: Build one feature completely before moving to the next. Also try to work on isolated features and split the work with your team mate.
5. **Test Frequently**: Ensure each feature works before proceeding


## Submission Requirements

1. Use `ngrok` to forward your local port on a public domain. You will need to sign up and follow the instrauction from the setup page: 
`https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/windows`. 

Make sure you pick the static domain and you run ngrok command on the port you are running your local app (usually 3000)
`ngrok http --url=premium-drake-jolly.ngrok-free.app 3000`


2. Provide the link in the Hackathon slack channel.
3. Your app will remain runing on your local host after the end of the Hackathon
4. Make sure you have a working application with as many UI components implemented
5. Make sure the app is demo-ready with mock data or basic database integration
6. Provide test credentials in case we cannot sign up and login with @shortpoint mail.
7. Provide a brief documentation of implemented features and achievements (Use AI to generate this)

Remember: **Design first, database second, authentication last!** Good luck! 🚀
