# Stand Alone - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Elevator Pitch

Stand Alone is a SaaS intranet solution designed for small to medium businesses that need to organize departmental information and create custom sites for different teams. Similar to Wix for hosting, Stand Alone allows companies to create multiple sites from a single tenant, where each department (HR, Finance, IT, Development, Sales) can have their own dedicated site with controlled access. Administrators can manage sites from a central dashboard at the tenant level, and also manage specific site settings, pages, themes, and assets at the individual site level.
